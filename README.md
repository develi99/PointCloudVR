# PointCloudVR
Live visualization of point clouds from a camera stream in VR using Meta Quest.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Loading, processing and streaming of RGB and depth data
- Real-time computation and visualization of Pointclouds on Meta Quest (Unity XR)
- Modular architecture for extension

## Video

We used PointCloudVR for making Teleoperated Demonstrations.

In this video we used a downsampled rgb and depth image (214x160 = ~34K). Each pixel is represented as a cube, so ~34K Cubes are rendered.
Here we reached ~70 fps rendering. The datastreaming is here the bottleneck with ~30 fps.
