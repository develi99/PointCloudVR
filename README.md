# ðŸ“¡ PointCloudVR

**PointCloudVR** enables live visualization of RGB-D point clouds streamed from an external camera into a VR environment using Meta Quest. It combines real-time depth processing, GPU-accelerated rendering, and XR controller interaction for immersive exploration of spatial data.

## ðŸš€ Features

- ðŸ”„ Real-time streaming of RGB and depth data via ZeroMQ
- ðŸ§  GPU-based computation and rendering of 3D point clouds
- ðŸŽ® Intuitive VR interaction using Meta Quest controllers (Unity XR)
- ðŸ§© Modular architecture â€“ easy to extend or integrate into other XR workflows

---

## ðŸŽ¥ Demo Video

PointCloudVR was used for **teleoperated robot demonstrations**.

A demo video is available in the [`video/`](video/) folder.

- Input resolution: **214 Ã— 160** (~34,000 points)
- Each pixel is visualized as a **3D cube**
- Achieved:
  - **~70 FPS rendering**
  - **~30 FPS data streaming** (main bottleneck)
